***This is a simple number guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a random number within a specified range. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

The user inputs the lower and upper bounds for the range.
A random number (x) is generated within this range.
The maximum number of guesses allowed (total_chances) is calculated based on the range size using the formula ceil(log2(upper - lower + 1)).
The user is prompted to guess the number, and feedback is provided if the guess is too high or too low.
The game continues until the user guesses correctly or runs out of guesses.
If the user guesses the number within the allowed attempts, they win; otherwise, the correct number is revealed.***
