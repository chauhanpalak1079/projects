# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The user is prompted to guess a random number within a specified range, and feedback is provided if the guess is too high or too low.

## How It Works

1. The user inputs the lower and upper bounds for the range.
2. A random number is generated within this range.
3. The maximum number of guesses allowed is calculated based on the range size.
4. The user is prompted to guess the number.
5. Feedback is provided if the guess is too high or too low.
6. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of guesses.
